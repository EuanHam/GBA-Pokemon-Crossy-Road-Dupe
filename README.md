Hi there, the goal of the game is to avoid the Pokeballs thrown at your Pokemon by Team Rocket.

To run, have some sort of Game Boy Advance emulator such as mGBA and open the app.gba file.

To begin, you can press START (enter/return) to begin the game.
To nagivate, use the arrow keys.
You want to navigate your way to the Pokemon Center, a safe zone.
If you win or lose, you can use the SELECT (back/delete) button to go back and restart.
